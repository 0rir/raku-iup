Files here follow four naming conventions.

1) stuff.raku    -- these are from previous authors. These may be
    moved to the other categories if appropriate.

2) 01-stuff.raku -- these are my examples which demostrate that
    something works a bit.

3) t-stuff.raku  -- these are translations from tutorial files from
    https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/ which are named like
    example2_2.c and/or example2_2.lua.  I'll use kebob-case.

4) e-stuff.raku  -- these are translated example files from
    https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/examples/C/ and lua/
